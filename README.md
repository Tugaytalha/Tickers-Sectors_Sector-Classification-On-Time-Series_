# Tickers-Sectors_Sector-Classification-On-Time-Series_
 This project aims to develop a classification model based on factors derived from time series data collected from various sectors. The goal is to identify similarities between sectors by analyzing the behavior of stocks within each sector. For instance, considering a stock X in a particular sector, if it exhibits different patterns compared to other stocks within the same sector during a certain period, we can hypothesize about its behavior relative to the sector's movements. This project was made as an artificial intelligence specialization program project.
